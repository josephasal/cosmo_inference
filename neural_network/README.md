#Code for the Neural network
* nn_training is training a basic neural network on the simulated data, then using the supernova data set to predict omega m and h
* Noisy data is the data from simulating distance modulus vs redshift, it contains some noise based on the mean error of the observational data
* Simulating data is how i simulated the data using the cosmology equaitons, i then saved this data to a csv to train a neural network
