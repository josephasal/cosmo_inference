# Cosmological Parameter inference using MCMC and Nerual Networks
This project uses both MCMC and NNs to infer cosmological parameters from the Lambda CDM model. The main parameters it estimates are Hubble constant (H0) and the matter density (omega m)
The MCMC is done using the Metropolis Hastings algorithm and I have introduced various optimisations to ensure a more robust sampling method.
Currently working on the Neural network.......
